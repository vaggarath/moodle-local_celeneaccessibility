# Celeneaccessibility

## Important : This plugin is still in early bÃªta! It works fine so far but no in depth test has been performed yet.

### Why this plugin?
This plugin respond to a need to add more options for user experience.
I called it an accessibility plugin but it's more a user experience improver.
We needed a tool to add more to the moodle "in core" accessibility which relies essentially on the teachers way of writtings their course without offering enough tools to enhance the display.
Some examples:

- Someone with visual deficiency may need to enlarge the text or may need to make the images' colors more vivid.

- The Dys community has even more issues to be addressed and writting this plugin was quite a challenge because we realised along the way that being a dys is being unique. Every dys has it's own way to apprehend reading and, overall, learning. Some needs special fonts while other will struggle with words, letters or line spacing. On another side of the spectrum, some have concentration trouble which can also be helped thanks to a reading helper which enhance only a couple of lines of reading while "caching" whats around, up and down.

- We also added a text to speech option. As much as a gadget as it seems, it may provide a usefull tool for some that do not have financial means to get a more professional tool.

The plugin is not really complicated in itself, the code is quite forward and relies essentially on the css to modify the pages. The trickiest was how to simplify the most possible the integration and adjustements needed into the theme's files as it doesn't seem possible yet to modify the theme renderer / drawers from a local plugin, (or i'm just not smart enough to figure how to! Frankly speaking it's more than probable).https://vinorodrigues.github.io/bootstrap-dark-5/

### Available options :
1. Dark theme
2. Blue light filter
3. Text size
4. Fonts choice
5. Letters spacing
6. Words spacing
7. Interline
8. Text case
9. Images' color rendering
10. Clic and selection improvment for motor impaired user
11. Reading guide line (activation on ESC key)
12. Text To Speech option (on right click)

## Theme necessities to use the plugin
```Important : Tested only with Moodle 4.0.4 to 4.1.1```
#### Pre-requisites
 - Ideally your theme should to be a child of the Boost theme.
 - The last moodle recommanded version of grunt needs to be installed.

#### List of the files
- **amd/src/guiding.js & amd/src/tts.js**  are both to enable the reading helper and the TTS option
- **layout/drawers.php** This is where the theme gets the user options from the database and sets the body classes
- **templates/drawers.mustache & head.mustache** 1st one is to dispatch body's classes, call the JS script and enable the reading helper

## What to do
You need to include these file into your child theme (or, if you're brave enough inside your boost theme. But it's more than VERY HIGHLY recommanded to use a child theme based on Boost).

Inside drawers.php don't forget to change the theme name !

Inside your theme you need to run the grunt command in order to compile the js files and be able to exploit them :
```shell
x$: cd path/to/your/moodle/theme/yourtheme
x$: grunt amd --force
```

### Potential error with Grunt
It's very unlikely if you use the last version of grunt & eshint but you may get an "err_func_loop" error from grunt when compiling.
This error is a false positive. You can either shut the error off by giving instruction to eshint or use the command --force
```
grunt amd --force
```

### The dark mode
It's the tricky part.
The way we worked around it is quite specific to our way of proposing the option before this plugin came to development.
We use the bootstrap plugin : https://vinorodrigues.github.io/bootstrap-dark-5/
The way it works :
We import the scss need file into the core.scss of our theme.
We trigger the night mode by adding a class to the HTML element.

The class is added through the drawers.php and the head.mustaches files.
